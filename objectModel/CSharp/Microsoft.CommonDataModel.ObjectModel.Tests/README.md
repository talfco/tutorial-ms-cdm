# Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Tests

The Object Model code includes unit tests for communicating with Azure Data Lake Storage via the ADLSAdapter in each supported language. These tests are disabled by default as they require a properly configured Azure Storage Account and configuration data for communicating with that account. If you have an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage account and wish to run these tests follow the instructions below.

### Instructions

1. Set the environment variables listed in the table below on the machine you wish to run the tests.
1. Install [Azure Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/).
1. Run the [CreateADLSData.ps1](CreateADLSData.ps1) powershell script. You will only need to run this script once, not each time you run the tests.
1. Now when running unit tests in any language the ADLSAdapter tests will be included.
